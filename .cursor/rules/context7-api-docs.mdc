# API Client Helper Scripts – Use Context7

When creating or editing **API client helper scripts**, always use the Context7 MCP tools to fetch the latest API documentation before implementing.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the library**  
   Call `resolve-library-id` with the API/SDK name (e.g. the official client library for the service).

2. **Query the docs**  
   Call `query-docs` with the resolved library ID and a specific question (e.g. authentication, request format, error handling).

3. **Implement from docs**  
   Use the returned docs and examples to write the helper (client setup, endpoints, types, errors).

## When This Applies

- Adding a new API client or wrapper.
- Adding endpoints or methods to an existing client.
- Fixing or refactoring code that calls an external API.

Do not guess API shapes or copy outdated examples; pull current docs from Context7 first.
